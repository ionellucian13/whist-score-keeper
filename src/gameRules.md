# Romanian Whist Rules

Romanian Whist is a trick-taking card game that combines skill and prediction.

## Players

- 3-6 players can participate
- Each player gets dealt a number of cards depending on the round

## Game Structure

- The game consists of multiple rounds
- The number of rounds depends on the number of players
- In each round, the number of cards dealt changes

## Round Structure

1. **Deal**: Players are dealt cards (number varies per round)
2. **Prediction**: Each player predicts how many tricks they'll win
   - Important: The sum of all predictions cannot equal the total number of tricks possible in the round
3. **Play**: Players take turns playing cards following standard trick-taking rules
4. **Scoring**: Points are awarded based on the accuracy of predictions

## Scoring System

- **Correct prediction**: Player earns 5 points plus the number of tricks won
- **Incorrect prediction**: Player loses points equal to the difference between their prediction and actual tricks won

## Game End

- The game ends after completing all rounds
- The player with the highest score wins

## Example

- Round with 5 tricks total:
  - Player A predicts 2 tricks and wins 2 → Score: 5 + 2 = 7 points
  - Player B predicts 1 trick but wins 3 → Score: -2 points (difference of 2)
  - Player C predicts 1 trick and wins 0 → Score: -1 point (difference of 1)
  - Total predictions: 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 tricks (valid, as it's not equal to 5)
